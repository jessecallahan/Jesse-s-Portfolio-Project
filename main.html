      </div>
        <div class="panel-body">I'm interested in learning coding for two main reasons: One, I want to know what jobs are avaliable in the field of coding and what languages I need to know to get hired. More specifically, I want to know how back end media file management systems work (video, audio, animation, etc.). I think it would be cool to work for youtube.com or the MLB at Bat application for smart phones. Second, I am interested in the art of coding. I am in the digital media field but have a true love for analog. With the capubilities of computers and smart phones, now and into the future, learning these basic coding priniciples - the fabric of the internet - is much like learning about analog synthesisers or old drum programming machines at their inception. I collect records. To relate coding to music I'd say some of the methods are 'old school' and much like a record collector, I like to learn about the 'old school' and the 'new school'.</div>
