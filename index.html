          <ol>
            <li>First we learned how to use css styles sheets</li>
            <li>We were then assigned to make to website mimicing what could possibly be used for an animal shelter. The made goal of this lesson was to get the columns and rows right and learn about styling using CSS.</li>
            <li>Here is the github link of our website <a href="https://github.com/jessecallahan/Animal_shelter.git">Animal shelter website</a></li>

            <li>First we learned about box modeling, floats, and borders.</li>
            <li>Here is a website showing you the three stages of the Kingdome in Seattle before, during, and after its implosion. The goal of this lesson was to get the basics of box modeling. Including: margin, padding, border, and backgorund color. </li>

            <p>"Funk is the absence of any and everything you can think of, but the very essence of all that is. And saying that, I'm saying funk is anything that we create in our minds that we want to do, what we want to be, but we don't have the resources."</p>

        <h2 class="panel-title"><strong>Coding Goals</strong></h2>
      </div>
        <div class="panel-body">I'm interested in learning coding for two main reasons: One, I want to know what jobs are avaliable in the field of coding and what languages I need to know to get hired. More specifically, I want to know how back end media file management systems work (video, audio, animation, etc.). I think it would be cool to work for youtube.com or the MLB at Bat application for smart phones. Second, I am interested in the art of coding. I am in the digital media field but have a true love for analog. With the capubilities of computers and smart phones, now and into the future, learning these basic coding priniciples - the fabric of the internet - is much like learning about analog synthesisers or old drum programming machines at their inception. I collect records. To relate coding to music I'd say some of the methods are 'old school' and much like a record collector, I like to learn about the 'old school' and the 'new school'.</div>
